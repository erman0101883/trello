# trello


 Completed both scenarios
 Those should run
 I left some prints consciously, myabe you want to observe
 Although the code is working, still some improvements but I dont want to wait and push it.
 
 
 objective.py file includes api testing
 objective2.py file includes selenium testing
 
 for objective2.py I did not give a username and password, if you write into the code your credentials it will work.
 
 
 thanks!
